The process of estimating the parameters of a camera is called camera calibration.

This means we have all the information (parameters or coefficients) about the camera required to determine an accurate relationship between a 3D point in the real world and its corresponding 2D projection (pixel) in the image captured by that calibrated camera.



Write a python script to automatically find the camera calibration parameters using a 6x8 checkerboard pattern. 

Record a video to show how the setup works.



You can find the checkerboard pattern here:

Explain the mathematical basis of how the checkerboard pattern helps in this calibration. Are there some alternate means by which a camera can be calibrated?

Write a code for a singly linked list that stores data of type int (using struct). It should contain functions :



Adding a new node, 

Deleting a particular node (referenced by the location),

Delete all the nodes from the list which contain a particular data say a number 5

Delete the complete linked list

Display the linked list

Display the inverted linked list

Display the total memory space occupied by the linked list

Delete all the nodes from the list which contain a particular data say a number 5 and the next subsequent node
